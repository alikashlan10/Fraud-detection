# fraudDetection

This project utilizes difference deep-learning algorithms to detect fraud operations on banking systems ( classification problem )

the objective was to build models from scratch using keras sequential-models , trying different layers and parameters to improve efficiency 
and compare it with with a pre-trained model (TabNet)
